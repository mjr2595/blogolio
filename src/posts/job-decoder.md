Keeping this one super short and sweet.

I had a blast being featured on the Job Decoder podcast! Hosted by my Torc pal [Angelos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloskatrantzis/), we chatted it up about improv theater, technical support, IT, and how you need empathy to thrive in all the above.

Check it out the stream recording on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7366488679034347521/) or [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIm4UyEKKxU).

Of course shout out to the best dev community in the game, [Torc](https://torc.community/). If you ain't there, you square. So [join](https://platform.torc.dev/#/r/gXg2hw2B/cp) already ya goober.
