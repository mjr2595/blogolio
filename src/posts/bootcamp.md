I did a bootcamp! Completed the 'Full Stack Web + Mobile Development' camp over at [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/). It was pretty sweet!

Full disclosure, I actually have a CS degree from UT Austin. BUT... and that's a BIG ol BUT... I never learned any web development. I did a good amount of theory stuff and networking. I learned Java. But then never really utilized any of these skills. Then BAM! Like 7 years went by üôÄ. Crazy how time flies. Long story short, I've been doing IT/Support. It's honestly been pretty interesting and I've learned a lot about tech just in general. Those on-call shifts are the best!

That said, I've been craving a change of pace. Specifically the breakneck speed of modern web dev. So here we are. I just graduated (with honors) üéì üéâ üèÖ

You can check out the course repo [here](https://github.com/mjr2595/Nucamp-Fullstack-Course). And my honors project repo [here](https://github.com/mjr2595/borker).

So yeah blogging...

I've been told tech/dev blog are a REQUIREMENT for any self-respecting web developer:

- ok ok you get it

So I'll be writing up quick lil blogs. I'm not really sure about what or how frequently. Keeping it light, casual, and fun. Like my dating life! jk I'm married.

Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
