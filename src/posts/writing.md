\***_Record scratch_**\* _Yep that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation._

Let's start with this whole reading thing. I was never really a "reader" type person. I did get into graphic novels after first reading [Watchmen](https://hardcover.app/books/watchmen) before the movie came out. It kinda blew my mind and idk Alan Moore really spoke to my teenage angst. But besides comics, I just didn't read. Even for school I would usually just read the spark notes or something and then bs my way to an A (sorry Mrs. Winstead).

Fast forward to the start of this year, my wife and I are expecting our first child and I'm trying to soak up as much knowledge as possible. So I got 2 books: [We're Pregnant! The First Time Dad's Pregnancy Handbook](https://hardcover.app/books/were-pregnant-the-first-time-dads-pregnancy-handbook) and [Transformed by Birth](https://hardcover.app/books/transformed-by-birth-cultivating-openness-resilience-and-strength-for-the-life-changing-journey-from-pregnancy-to-parenthood). Both really great and def recommend. Ok so I finished the books and now I'm feeling pretty good. Like hey I can get behind this whole reading thing. It feels good to not stare at a screen and still gain knowledge and perspective. 🌈🌟

So baby pops out. Of course, things get a lil busy. Not sure if you know this but babies kinda take up a lot of time. I do try to keep reading. I actually read [Stuart Little](https://hardcover.app/books/stuart-little) and [The Pearl](https://hardcover.app/books/the-pearl) to our newborn. But it got tougher as she grew and started needing more interaction. But hey I don't just give up (well maybe for a small bit), I pivot to _audiobooks_. And now we're really cookin with grease! I can zip through one of these bad boys in no time. And that's while still making it through my massive podcast queue for the week.

Alrighty now I'm kinda starting to feel more like a "reader" type person. Torc then starts up a book club. I really love that Torc is a tech community but this book club is focusing on non-tech, fiction books. And now I guess at this point I love books so much that I join a second book club lol. This one is with the [Overcommitted podcast](https://overcommitted.dev/) community.

ALL THIS TO SAY, the next book in the Overcommitted book club is [Writing for Developers](https://hardcover.app/books/writing-for-developers) by Piotr Sarna and Cynthia Dunlop. The whole point is to literally write more. So here I am (insert this blog post title). It's also nice that this is at the tail end of the year because I really would like to try and write more in 2026. I like to write. At least I think I do... I guess I don't get enough time to dedicate to it to really find out. But I want to give it the ol college try. I'm hoping to get ~~peer pressured~~ encouraged to write more by members of the book club.

That's it. That's where we're at. I don't know yet if I'm really going to write more (and become a "writer" type person) but hey at least I'm reading more. And that's a win in my book (see what I did there).
