Yo! I’m a _Software Engineer_ with a background in tech support leadership and IT. I help build modules at LogicMonitor, making sure enterprises get all that juicy observability data. I also enjoy building web apps and tinkering with self-hosting. When I’m not coding, you can find me hanging out with my dog and two cats (oh yeah and wife too), performing improv theater, or tweaking my pour over coffee technique.
