So this is the obligatory new year post. 2024 was kinda a big deal. I got a new job -- finally as a software engineer. My wife got a new job. We did doom metal goat yoga. Yeah you read that right. So yeah kinda a big deal. Oh yeah and we found out we're PREGNANT! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Wild stuff. I'm super super excited and also a tad bit nervous. It goes without saying that 2025 will be an even BIGGER year for us. As I write this, we actually have a birthing class tomorrow and the next day. Overall, lots and lots of learning! I going to be a freakin DAD! I've already been an avid pundamentalist of sorts, but now I really have to exercise those dad joke muscles ðŸ’ª

Well that's about it for this post. I'll catch y'all in the next one. Don't forget to check your oil and rotate your tires!
